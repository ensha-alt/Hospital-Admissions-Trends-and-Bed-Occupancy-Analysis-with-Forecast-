# 🏥 Hospital Admission Trends & Bed Occupancy Analysis

An interactive **Streamlit-based healthcare analytics project** that analyzes hospital admissions, forecasts bed occupancy, and visualizes patient trends.  
This project combines **data analytics, forecasting, and dashboarding** to help hospitals make better data-driven decisions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Hospitals often struggle to balance patient inflow and bed availability.  
This project explores **admission trends and bed occupancy patterns** using hospital data to identify insights and predict future demand.

The workflow includes:
1. Data collection and cleaning (Raw → Processed)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Jupyter Notebook
3. Forecasting admissions and occupancy using Prophet
4. Visualization using Power BI (prototype) and Streamlit (final deployment)
5. Deployment on **Streamlit Cloud**

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Analyze department-wise and time-based admissions  
- Monitor bed occupancy trends across departments  
- Predict future admissions using time-series forecasting  
- Build an interactive web dashboard for visualization
